- 👋 Hi im Milo
- In the process of becoming an Information Security Engineer.
  I am a passionate student for information security engineer with a strong background in identifying and mitigating 
  vulnerabilities in high profile systems. My dedication to cyber security has led me to discover and successfully address
  security flaws that were actually already found but unknown to me. Below is an overview of my accomplishments and qualifications.
  
- 👀  My interests as a future engineer focus on:
  1 - Technology Innovation: I am excited to be at the forefront of technological innovation. Engineering gives me the opportunity to explore creative solutions to current and future challenges.
  2 - Cyber Security: My passion for cyber security is rooted in the belief that protecting data and systems is critical in an increasingly connected world. I want to continue to contribute to the defense of confidential information and privacy online.
  3 - Continuous Learning: As an engineer, I value continuous learning and adapting to a constantly evolving technological environment. I am always willing to acquire new skills and knowledge to keep myself updated.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- I am currently in my second year of studies related to computer science, development and security. 
  But for as long as I can remember I have been connected to the net and I know my way around better than I ever thought possible.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and belong to the biggest companies, those with the biggest reputation and support the development of new computer systems
      through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, Cloud Technology and Advanced Cybersecurity.
